            },
            "correctOption": "D",
            "overview": "The LSAT Analytical Reasoning section typically includes games that involve sequencing, matching, and grouping. Quantitative Comparison, however, is not a common game type in this section. It is more related to assessing mathematical comparisons, which are not the focus of Analytical Reasoning questions."

            },
            "correctOption": "B",
            "overview": "In Sequencing games, the primary task is to determine the logical order of events or items based on the clues provided. This involves arranging the items in a sequence that satisfies all the given conditions."

            "correctOption": "C",
            "overview": "For Grouping games, the most critical skill is the ability to divide objects into different groups based on a set of specific rules. This involves understanding the rules and applying them effectively to categorize the objects as required."

            "correctOption": "A",
            "overview": "The method of reasoning described as 'Drawing a general conclusion from specific examples' involves observing particular instances and then formulating a broad statement that applies to similar situations. This is a common logical reasoning method where specific observations lead to a generalization."
        },
        {
            "questionNumber": 5,

            "overview": "Criticizing an argument for 'Overlooking possible alternatives' suggests that the argument fails to consider other plausible explanations or solutions that could undermine its conclusion. This is a common flaw in reasoning where the argument does not account for other variables that could affect the outcome."

            "correctOption": "B",
            "overview": "The reasoning 'A scientist claims a theory is true because all attempts to disprove it have failed' is analogous to arguing from a position where the absence of counter-evidence is taken as support for the claim. This method of reasoning assumes that because something has not been proven false, it must therefore be true, which is a logical fallacy known as argument from ignorance."
