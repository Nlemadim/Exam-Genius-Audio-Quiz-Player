      "questionNumber": 2,

      "question": "What significant immigration policy did the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 introduce?",

    {
      "questionNumber": 4,
      "question": "What was the main weakness of the Articles of Confederation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "It gave too much power to the national government.",
        "B": "It did not provide a national currency.",
        "C": "It did not allow for a president.",
        "D": "It gave too little power to the national government."
      },
      "correctOption": "D",
      "overview": "The Articles of Confederation established the first governmental structure unifying the 13 colonies that had fought in the American Revolution. However, this document put too little power in the central government. Congress, under the Articles, was not strong enough to enforce laws or raise taxes, making it difficult to support a national defense or fund the government."
    },
    {
      "questionNumber": 5,
      "question": "Under the Articles of Confederation, how many states needed to agree in order to pass a new law?",
      "options": {
        "A": "7 out of 13",
        "B": "9 out of 13",
        "C": "11 out of 13",
        "D": "13 out of 13"
      },
      "correctOption": "B",
      "overview": "The Articles of Confederation required a supermajority for the passage of most types of legislation. Specifically, to pass a new law, 9 out of the 13 states had to agree. This high threshold made it difficult for Congress to take action on many issues."
    },
    {
      "questionNumber": 6,
      "question": "Which of the following was a power that Congress had under the Articles of Confederation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "To regulate interstate commerce",
        "B": "To levy taxes",
        "C": "To declare war",
        "D": "To enforce laws"
      },
      "correctOption": "C",
      "overview": "Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress had the power to declare war. However, it lacked many other powers that would be considered essential for a strong central government, such as the power to levy taxes, regulate trade, or enforce laws. This limitation was a significant factor in the decision to draft the Constitution."
