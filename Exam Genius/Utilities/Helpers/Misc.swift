This gives 4x - 2y = 2. Adding this to the first equation eliminates y, leading to 7x = 7, so x = 1. However, the correct manipulation actually leads to x = 2, indicating a mistake in the initial calculation."

       "overview": "To find the value of y, first solve one of the equations for x in terms of y (or vice versa), then substitute this expression into the other equation. Using elimination, multiplying the second equation by 2.5 (to make coefficients of x equal) and adding to the first can directly lead to the value of y. Solving the equations correctly shows that y = 2."

       "correctOption": "A",
       "overview": "Adding the two equations x + y = 10 and x - y = 6 gives 2x = 16, because the y terms cancel out. Therefore, the value of 2x is 16. This method of solving simultaneous equations by addition is a quick way to find the value of one variable when the coefficients of the other variable are opposites."
