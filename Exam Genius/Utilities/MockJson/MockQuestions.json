      "question": "What is the future value of $100 invested for 2 years at an annual interest rate of 5%?",
      "options": {
        "A": "$110.25",
        "B": "$105",
        "C": "$210",
        "D": "$115"
      },
      "correctOption": "A",
      "overview": "The future value (FV) of an investment is calculated using the formula FV = PV * (1 + r)^n, where PV is the present value (or initial investment), r is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of years. Plugging in the values, we get FV = $100 * (1 + 0.05)^2 = $110.25."

        "questionNumber": 1,
        "question": "Which of the following is a primary tool used in the Improve phase of DMAIC?",
        "options": {
          "A": "Fishbone Diagram",
          "B": "Design of Experiments",
          "C": "Control Chart",
          "D": "SIPOC Diagram"
        },
        "correctOption": "B",
        "overview": "In the Improve phase of DMAIC, the focus is on identifying solutions to eliminate the root causes of defects. Design of Experiments (DoE) is a primary tool used in this phase to systematically plan and conduct experiments that help in identifying optimal conditions that lead to the desired improvement."

    {
      "questionNumber": 2,
      "question": "What is the purpose of using pilot runs in the Improve phase of DMAIC?",
      "options": {
        "A": "To identify new defects",
        "B": "To validate measurement systems",
        "C": "To test the effectiveness of proposed solutions",
        "D": "To define the project scope"
      },
      "correctOption": "C",
      "overview": "Pilot runs are conducted in the Improve phase to test the effectiveness of proposed solutions on a smaller scale before full-scale implementation. This approach helps in identifying potential issues and assessing the impact of changes, ensuring that the solutions are effective and feasible."
